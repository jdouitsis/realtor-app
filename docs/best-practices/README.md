| Topic                                     | Covers                                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| [Routing](./routing.md)                   | Type-safe URLs, search params, navigation         |
| [Shared Package](./shared-package.md)     | When to use `@app/shared` vs tRPC type inference  |

## When to Consult Best Practices

- **Building URLs programmatically** → `routing.md`
- **Navigating with search params** → `routing.md`
- **Using route context** → `routing.md`
- **Link component patterns** → `routing.md`
- **Sharing types between server and client** → `shared-package.md`
- **Database enum values needed in UI** → `shared-package.md`
